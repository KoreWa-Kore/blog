If for some reason you find yourself having an excess of wealth and wish to share a bit of it with me because you enjoy my things. You definitely can. It's certainly not expected of anyone, and part of the reason why I have this blog is so that anyone can read my articles without having to deal with substack possibly trying to push you to be a paid subscriber. But it really is appreciated. I am currently financially dependent on people I don't want to be dependent on who hold it over me. And every little bit does help me get out of there.

Whether you do or don't, thank you for checking this page.

*A small disclaimer though: even if you donate. Unless I actually like and believe in what you're doing. Please don't give me money expecting me to shill your coin.*
