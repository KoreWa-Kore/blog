If for some reason you find yourself having an excess of wealth and wish to share a bit of it with me because you enjoy my things. You definitely can. It's certainly not expected of anyone, and part of the reason why I have this blog is so that anyone can read my articles without having to deal with substack possibly trying to push you to be a paid subscriber. But it really is appreciated. I am currently financially dependent on people I don't want to be dependent on who hold it over me. Any bit of financial support is appreciated, and is a building block to help me achieve independence. 

Whether you do decide to donate or don't, thank you for checking out this page.

*A small disclaimer though: even if you donate. Unless I actually like and believe in what you're doing. Please don't give me money expecting me to shill your coin.*
